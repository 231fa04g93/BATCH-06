🌱 Smart Irrigation System

A Smart Irrigation System designed to conserve water and improve crop health by automating the irrigation process based on real-time environmental data. This project is currently in development and focuses on the frontend built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 📌 Project Description

Traditional irrigation methods often lead to the inefficient use of water and reduced crop yield due to lack of data-driven decisions. This Smart Irrigation System aims to address those issues by:

- Monitoring environmental parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity
- Making intelligent decisions on when and how much to irrigate
- Reducing human dependency and operational cost
- Promoting sustainable and efficient water use
